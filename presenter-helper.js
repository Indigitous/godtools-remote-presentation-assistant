        "1": "<p><strong>Helpful Questions:</strong></p><p>Do you believe in God?</p><p>Why do you believe (or not believe) in God? How do you feel about that?</p>",
        "2": "<p><strong>How would you define sin?</strong></p><p>Can be answered 100 different ways. In fact there is no wrong answer. Anything that is not pleasing to God or goes against his Word is sin. Everyone will get the answer to this question because there are many ways to sin. They&rsquo;re telling you in their own words what sin is by giving you one example.</p><p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Trying to swim to Hawaii from California.</p><p>In relation to the goal, we don&rsquo;t make it. In relation to others trying to swim the whole distance, we may do better, but still not reach the goal. We can&rsquo;t make it on our own effort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Have you ever sinned before? </strong></p><p>This question on the surface sounds too simple, but it is perhaps the most significant in the booklet. To clearly and honestly admit that one has sinned, shows one&rsquo;s need for forgiveness. God&rsquo;s requirement to get into heaven is perfection. Nobody is perfect, so somehow we all need to find forgiveness in God&rsquo;s eyes. They will be in a dilemma after they&rsquo;ve answered this question. Humanly speaking, there&rsquo;s no way to work back to perfection.</p>",
        "3": "<p><strong>Why did Christ die on the cross?</strong></p><p>Don&rsquo;t answer this question for the person, let them tell you first. The answer is found in the first five words of the next verse you&rsquo;ll read in 1 Corinthians 15:3-6 &ldquo;Christ died for our sins&hellip;&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the Gospel message, the good news. You&rsquo;ll come back to review this point again.</p><p><strong>Romans 5:8: &ldquo;Why did Christ have to die for us?</strong></p><p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Traffic Judge.</p><p>Someone else paying the penalty in our place. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say you were driving down the street at 70 mph. You were stopped by a traffic policeman and taken in before the judge, who happened to be your father. Now, your dad loves you very much, but he is also the most honest judge in town. He sees you walk in and says, &ldquo;Oh, no, what are you doing here?&rdquo; The policeman says, &ldquo;driving 70 mph in a 35 mph zone.&rdquo; Your dad, the judge, says, &ldquo;How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?&rdquo; And if you&rsquo;re honest, how do you plead? Guilty, right? So the judge says, &ldquo;$50 or five days in jail.&rdquo; You reach in your wallet but don&rsquo;t have the $50, just a crumpled football ticket stub. You know you&rsquo;re broke and can&rsquo;t possibly pay the fine, so you turn to leave with the policeman.</p><p>But wait! Just then, your father stands up, takes off his robe, steps down where you are, reaches in his own wallet, takes out the $50, and offers it to you as payment for your fine.</p><p>This is a picture of what God has done for us. We are all guilty before Him. He is a just and fair judge. We have a penalty to pay that we cannot pay. He stepped down out of heaven through His Son, Jesus Christ, and has offered the payment for each person&rsquo;s sin.</p>",
        "4": "<p><strong>What do you think this verse is saying? (referring to Ephesians 2:8-9)</strong></p><p>This is the big clarifying question in the booklet. It allows you to see if they fully understand the first three points in the booklet. The answer is we are saved by placing our trust in Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross to pay for one&rsquo;s sins (by grace, gift of God), not by works (not from yourselves).</p><p>You can go back and review pages 4-5 of the booklet by simply asking: &ldquo;What is it that separates one from God?&rdquo; The answer is sin.</p><p>If needed, look at point three of the booklet (pages 6-7) and ask: &ldquo;Once again, why did Christ die on the cross?&rdquo; The answer is to pay for our sin.</p><p>To clarify this point further, you can ask: &ldquo;Is there anything in our own power that we can do to get rid of our sin?&rdquo; Answer: no.</p><p>In essence, what you&rsquo;ve just done is reviewed the key points of the booklet again. This repetition is good and really clarifies the gospel to them. They are telling you what is the Gospel is! Basically, don&rsquo;t try to remember these extra questions, just ask questions two and three again, just using your own words.</p>",
        "5": "<p><strong>What is the main difference between the circle on the left and the circle on the right?</strong></p><p>Again, always give the person the opportunity to answer first and think about it. The answer is where the &ldquo;cross&rdquo; is. In the circle on the left Christ is outside the life, in the circle on the right, Christ is in the life. Ask: &ldquo;If Christ is in someone&rsquo;s life, what is one of the most important things that He&rsquo;ll do for them? Answer: forgive them of their sin.</p><p><strong>Ask:</strong> If Christ forgives someone of their sin, is there anything that would stand between them and God?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>nothing, Christ did it all on the cross. Question five gives you a second full opportunity to let them communicate back to you the gospel message in points 2 through 4 of the booklet.</p><p><strong>CIRCLES:</strong></p><p>Again, emphasize Christ&rsquo;s death as the issue &ndash; &ldquo;The circle on the left shows a person who hasn&rsquo;t trusted in Christ&rsquo;s death to pay for his sins. The one on the right has. Everyone is born in the first circle. When we accept Christ&rsquo;s death to pay for our sins, we are born into the second circle.</p><p>&nbsp;<p>&ldquo;Who is paying for the person&rsquo;s sins on the left? (he is) On the right? (Jesus is).</p></p><p>&ldquo;How many sins does the person on the left have forgiven? (none) On the right? (all) &ldquo;Where will the person on the left spend eternity? (hell) On the right? (Heaven). &ldquo;Which circle are you?&rdquo;</p>",
